This project is a mathematical exploration of Abstract Algebra
concepts, particularly involving polynomials operating on
different types of Python objects.  The code is all tested
using version 3.10 of Python.

The main concepts here are the following:
* commutative ring properties
* generalized single-variable polynomials
* Python dunder methods (e.g. `__add__`, `__mul__`, `__eq__`, etc.)
* dynamic type checking
* unit testing

The best place to start reading is [commutative_ring.py](./commutative_ring.py).
